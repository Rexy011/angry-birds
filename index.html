    <h1>angry birds 2</h1>
    <p>Angry Birds is a Finnish action, puzzle, and strategy based media franchise created by Rovio Entertainment, and 
    owned by Sega. The game series focuses on the titular flock of colorful angry birds who try to save their eggs
    from green-colored pigs. Inspired by the game Crush the Castle,[1] the game has been praised for its
    successful combination of fun gameplay, comical style, and low price. Its popularity led to many spin-offs; 
    versions of Angry Birds created for PCs and video game consoles, a market for merchandise featuring its 
    characters, Angry Birds Toons, a televised animated series, and two films; The Angry Birds Movie and its 
    sequel The Angry Birds Movie 2. By January 2014, there had been over 2 billion downloads across all platforms,
    including both regular and special editions.[2][3]</p>

    <p>By July 2015, the series' games had been downloaded more than 3 billion times collectively,[4] making it
    the most downloaded freemium game series of all time. The original Angry Birds has been called "One of the 
    most mainstream games out right now,"[5] "One of the great runaway hits of 2010",[6] and "The largest mobile
    app success the world has seen so far".[7] The first main-series video game sequel, Angry Birds 2, was 
    released on 30 July 2015</p>.

    <p>The first game in the series was initially released on 11 December 2009 for iOS.[8] At the time, the 2009 
    swine flu epidemic was in the news, so the staff decided to use pigs as the enemies of the Angry Birds.[9]
    The company released ports of the game to other touchscreen smartphone operating systems, including
    Android. In early 2019, all remaining Angry Birds games released before October 2014 (with the exception
    of Friends) were discontinued and removed from app stores, though Bad Piggies was added back in early
    2020. Rovio has declined to explain their reasoning behind the decision apart from a brief tweet and 
    support response, both giving different answers.[10] However, in June 2021, by popular demand of the
    fans, Rovio announced that the classic games will be available on the stores again sometime in the 
    future.[11] A recreated version of the original Angry Birds game known as Rovio Classics: Angry Birds
    came to mobile platforms on 31 March 2022.[12]</p>

    <p>In August 2023, Sega acquired Rovio Entertainment. The deal was closed on August 17 2023, rendering Sega the
    current owner of the Angry Birds brand alongside their subsidiary Rovio</p>
